After you clone this repository into your local, drag the "web_application_assignment_data.csv" into src folder.

Make sure the csv file's location is src/web_application_assignment_data.csv.

Then, run the following command and test on local.

Otherwise I sent a video through wetransfer in a separate email where you can see how the web app looks on my local side.

```cd d3-nus```

```npm install```

```npm audit fix```

```npm start```
